== Vim syntax highlight and support files for qmake.

It just provides the usual syntax highlight for qmake files (`.pro` and `.pri`,
but possibly I'll add other file terminations), plus the usual settings like
http://vimhelp.appspot.com/options.txt.html#%27commentstring%27[`'commentstring'`].

I have other plans, like a `:QMake` command that could help in setting things
like paths and other configuration variables for syntax cheking, configuring
https://github.com/thinca/vim-quickrun[QuickRun] or
https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch[Dispatch], but this is a lot of work, and
zero has been done so far, so it's unlikely to happen at this point.
